## Focus

**Onion / ports-and-adapters / layered architecture for a TypeScript/Node backend** — the decisions
about **which ring backend code lives in and which way its dependencies may point** across the Fastify
modules and the pure domain core.

A well-structured backend is onion-shaped (ports-and-adapters behind a DI Container). This skill's job
is to make that structure **explicit and enforceable**, so every new or changed module follows the
pattern rather than letting the layering erode. It covers **boundaries and placement only** — not the
syntax of the tools inside each ring.

## What it covers

- **The four rings** mapped to concrete folders — domain core (your shared contracts + adapter ports;
  the pure core), application (`service.ts` + `repository.ts`), infrastructure (`adapters/*`,
  `platform/*`, `db/*`), presentation (`routes.ts`).
- **The inward dependency rule** — an import matrix of what each ring may and must not import, with
  the rationale, plus the two cheap manual checks that catch the common violations.
- **Ports & the composition root** — interfaces in your shared package (`adapters.ts`), implementations
  in `adapters/*`, all wired in the `Container`; services depend on interfaces and resolve concretes off
  the Container; cross-cutting data access shared via `container.<x>Repo`, never a sibling import.
- **Persistence & contracts** — Drizzle queries confined to the repository, the row → DTO
  map-at-the-seam rule, Zod contracts in your shared package as the shared domain + boundary type,
  "parse, don't validate" at every edge (HTTP in/out, untrusted output), and secrets isolation.
- **Recipes** — step-by-step for adding a new module and for adding a new adapter/port.
- **An architecture-smells checklist** for reviews.

## When to use it

- Adding or changing a backend module (route / service / repository).
- Adding an external integration, or deciding where an SDK/network/disk call belongs.
- Wiring something into the DI `Container`, or deciding whether a route/service may import Drizzle, an
  adapter, or another module.
- Reviewing a module's layering, or keeping the domain core framework-free.
- Deciding where a Zod contract or a persistence-to-DTO mapping should live.

## Related skills (and how this one differs)

This skill is intentionally narrow so it complements rather than duplicates the others:

| Skill | Scope | Boundary vs this skill |
|-------|-------|------------------------|
| **onion-architecture** (this) | **Where** backend code lives — rings, placement, import boundaries, the Container | — |
| `engineering-paved-path:drizzle-orm-patterns` | **How** to write Drizzle — schema, queries, relations, transactions, migrations | Use it for query syntax; use this skill for *which layer the query lives in*. |
| `engineering-paved-path:fastify-best-practices` | **How** Fastify works — routes, plugins, hooks, validation, serialization | Use it for route mechanics; use this skill for *routes as a thin presentation ring*. |
| `engineering-paved-path:postgresql-table-design` | Postgres schema/index/constraint design | Use it for table design; this skill only treats the DB as the outermost ring behind a repository. |
| `engineering-paved-path:zod` | Zod schema/validation syntax | Use it for writing schemas; this skill decides *where contracts sit and how they cross boundaries*. |
| `engineering-paved-path:fastify-best-practices` + `engineering-paved-path:typescript-expert` | framework + type-level depth | Orthogonal — language/framework detail, not layering. |
| `engineering-paved-path:frontend-ui-architecture` | **Where** frontend (React/Next.js) code lives | The frontend sibling of this skill; same philosophy, other half of the stack. |

Rule of thumb: **this skill decides the rings and boundaries; the others decide the code inside them.**

## Version

**1.0.0** — current (2026-06-19). See changelog below.

Versioning policy (semver):
- **patch** — wording/clarity fixes, link updates, no guidance change.
- **minor** — new rules, new reference files, or expanded coverage that's backward-compatible.
- **major** — a change in recommended structure/conventions that would contradict prior guidance.

The version is also recorded in the `version:` field of [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) frontmatter.

### Changelog

- **1.0.0** (2026-06-19) — Initial skill: `SKILL.md` + `references/the-onion.md`,
  `references/dependency-rules.md`, `references/persistence-and-contracts.md`, and `evals/evals.json`.
  Grounded in the ports-and-adapters literature (the Container as the single composition root, ports in
  a shared package, a canonical vertical-slice module) and the verified source list below.
