// Stop hook for the engineering-insights skill.

// The `Stop` event fires after EVERY turn, and there is no "session ended" event
// that can still make Claude act — so this nudges at most ONCE per session via two
// irreducible guards:
//   1. stop_hook_active — don't re-fire within the same stop sequence (anti-loop);
//   2. a per-session marker file — fire only the first time, not once per turn.
// On that single firing it blocks the stop and asks Claude to run /engineering-insights
// (a hook can't invoke a skill directly — it injects the instruction; Claude acts on it).
//
// Registered as a Stop hook (via the plugin's hooks/hooks.json). Never breaks the
// session: every path exits 0.
